# Project instructions

## Documentation
After implementing any significant feature (new auth method, new API endpoint, new environment variable, new UI flow, etc.), add a section to `README.md` documenting it. Follow the existing style: plain prose "How it works" explanation, an environment-variables table if applicable, and setup/local-testing steps. Place the new section near related content (e.g. a new auth method goes near "Password reset").
