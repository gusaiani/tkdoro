# Agent Instructions

## README

Always update `README.md` when making changes that affect how someone sets up, runs, tests, or deploys the project. This includes:

- New dependencies or changes to existing ones
- New environment variables or changes to `.env.example`
- New npm/pip/brew install steps
- Changes to how tests are run
- Changes to the database setup or migration process
- New files or directories that belong in the Files section
- Changes to deployment steps

Keep the README accurate and up to date. A stale README is worse than no README.
